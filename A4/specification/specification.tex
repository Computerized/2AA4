\section*{Design Introduction}
\subsection*{Likely Changes}
This project was designed with the idea that the whole game of 2048 could be completely replaced with another game using a similar setup. For this reason, the 4x4 grid and the operations to carry out a game of 2048 are completely separate. The 4x4 board is defined as its own object, with only basic methods such as getters and setters for the grid data and score available. The setup for the game 2048 is a child class of Board, and it contains all the operations necessary for a 4x4 game of 2048. If you were however to create a different score based game based on a similar board, it could be re-purposed to be used for that setup.
\subsection*{Design Overview}
The design for the 2048 game involves four separate modules. The first module is Board, which emulates a 4x4 grid of numbers, and keeps track of the score. The 4x4 grid data is stored using a two dimensional array, where the rows and column of the array correspond to the rows and columns of the 2048 board. The second module, ActiveBoard, is a Board object which contains all the necessary operations inherent to the 2048 game. It is a child class of Board, and thus inherits its data structure and state variables. The third module is the GUI module, which is a specialized JFrame (ie it inherits JFrame). This module covers the graphical display of the game state, namely the 4x4 grid and the current user score. It also handles user key inputs through the implementation of the KeyListener interface. The final module of the program is Game, which is the controller that operates the various classes. It takes in user input and computes the game states through operations performed on the ActiveBoard class. When Game reaches an end state (by lack of moves or user exit) it terminates the program.

\section*{Design Critique}

\subsubsection*{Information Hiding}
The concept of information hiding was applied throughout the modules. For example, and methods that did not need to be accessed outside of the class, such as \texttt{getUserInput()} or \texttt{endGame()} in Game were made private, whereas methods that needed to be accessed outside of the class were made public, such as \texttt{canMove()} for ActiveBoard. State variables were all made private, as any accessing of these variables would be done through their respective get methods. The exception to this rule was the state variables for Board, which were given a privacy level of protected, as they would need to be accessed by any child classes of Board. 

\subsubsection*{Cohesion}
On a general level, the modules in the 2048 program had a high degree of cohesion. Each module only contains methods that directly relate to the effective function of the program, with no unnecessary methods being included. For example, the ActiveBoard module, which emulates the behaviour of a 2048 board, only contains methods that are necessary for the correct function of the board, containing only methods to shift the board values, a method to add a random new value, and to determine if certain operations are valid. Otherwise, no other functions are added as no other computation is necessary for the correct operation of the program.

\subsubsection*{Generality}
The whole setup of the 4x4 board was made as general as possible, as the Board module only contained enough functions to set and get state variables. Using this generalized module, the ActiveBoard module is designed to be a specialization on the Board module, with more specific restraints and operations applied to the Board.

\subsubsection*{Consistency}
The specification strives to make the program as consistent as possible. On a superficial level, the naming conventions for both the methods and variables follow the same format, namely camel notation. On a more structural level, the structure of the classes and methods were designed consistently. For example, any operations on ActiveBoard were consistently performed using the built in methods (via blackbox methods) rather than extracting the data from the object, performing the computations, then updating the ActiveBoard afterwards. On that note, all methods were implemented with the concept of blackboxing in mind, only taking in a parameter and performing the necessary transitions without any further interaction.

\subsubsection*{Essentiality}
All of the modules within the program can be considered to be essential, as no module contains multiple methods performing the same task. The shift methods in ActiveBoard do perform the same general task, but since the execution of the task in each direction is different, the task was separated across four separate methods for the sake of program simplicity and understandablity (whereas the \texttt{canMove(direction)} method was kept as one method due to the similarity in the tasks in each direction and the simplicity of the tasks).

\subsubsection*{Minimality}
The modules outlined in the MIS were kept as minimal as possible. With the exception of the controller module, all methods (not including the constructors) in the other three modules were minimal, as no method both mutated the state of the object or returned an output value. The exception for the controller class was made since the controller would have to handle user input and output as well as update the game state at the same time, requiring the method in control of the game flow to both cause a transition and an output.
